		 I'm web developer
			developer, web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer, software engineer,
			computer scientist, game programmer, game developer and software analyst. The use of the term programmer as
			applied to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or even derogatory. British
			countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer, as she was
			the first to publish part of a program (specifically an algorithm) intended for implementation on Charles
			Babbage's analytical engine, in October 1842. The algorithm was used to calculate Bernoulli numbers.[7]
			Because Babbage's machine was never completed as a functioning standard in Lovelace's time, she
			unfortunately never had the opportunity to see the algorithm in action. The ENIAC programming team,
			consisting of Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman were
			the first regularly working programmers.[8][9] International Programmers' Day is celebrated annually on 7
			January.[10] In 2009, the government of Russia decreed a professional annual holiday known as Programmers'
			Day to be celebrated on 13 September (12 September in leap years). It had already been an unofficial holiday
			before that in many countries. The word software was used as early as 1953, but did not regularly appear in
			print until the 1960s.[11] Before this time, computers were programmed either by customers or the few
			commercial computer manufacturers of the time, such as UNIVAC and IBM. The first company founded to
			specifically provide software products and services was the Computer Usage Company, in 1955.[12] The
			software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in
			mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments and businesses created a demand for software. Many of
			these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers; some were distributed freely between
			users of a particular machine for no charge. And others were developed on a commercial basis. Other firms,
			such as Computer Sciences Corporation (founded in 1959) also started to grow. The computer/hardware
			manufacturers soon started bundling operating systems, system software and programming environments with
			their machines.[citation needed] The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer ("PC")
			in the mid-1970s, which brought computing to the average office worker. In the following years the PC also
			helped create a constantly-growing market for games, applications and utilities software. CP/M, later
			replaced by DOS, Microsoft's Windows popular operating system of the time.[13] portfolio programmer gaurav
			In the early years of the 21st century, another successful business model has arisen for hosted software,
			called software-as-a-service, or SaaS. From the point of view of producers of some proprietary software,
			SaaS reduces the concerns about unauthorized copying, since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by
			definition, no client software is loaded onto the end user's PC. SaaS is typically run out of the cloud.
			Computer programmers write, test, debug, and maintain the detailed instructions, called computer programs,
			that computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical
			structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming — advanced computing
			technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the role of a programmer
			and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the
			organization. Programmers work in many settings, including corporate information technology ("IT")
			departments, big software companies, small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many
			professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is not
			typically required to work as a programmer, although professional certifications are commonly held by
			programmers. Programming is widely considered a profession (although some[who?] authorities disagree on the
			grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession). Programmers' work varies
			widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions
			involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an
			aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours, more
			complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered 'complete' but rather
			are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers work together as a
			team under a senior programmer's supervision. portfolio A software engineer writing JavaScript portfolio
			programmer gaurav Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more
			senior programmers and by systems analysts. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the
			programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The
			programmer codes these instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages
			are used depending on the purpose of the program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business
			applications that typically run on mainframe and midrange computers, whereas Fortran is used in science and
			engineering. C++ and Python are widely used for both scientific and business applications. Java, C#, JS and
			PHP are popular programming languages for Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more
			than one programming language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages
			relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred to by the language they know, e.g. as Java
			programmers, or by the type of function they perform or environment in which they work: for example,
			database programmers, mainframe programmers, or Web developers. When making changes to the source code that
			programs are made up of, programmers need to make other programmers aware of the task that the routine is to
			perform. They do this by inserting comments in the source code so that others can
			portfolio programmer gaurav Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a
			computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer "languages," such as
			SQL, Java, Python, and C++.
